DNS Checker for Microsoft Office 365

This is a simple GUI-based tool for checking DNS records used with Office 365 and Lync Online. 

Rather than having to run several NSLookup commands to verify Office 365 DNS records, simply plug your domain into DNS Checker and it will display all relevant Office 365 DNS records for your domain. 

You can check the records via a public DNS server, or your internal network.
